# Min-JS-Dev-Env

This is a minimalist javascript dev environment using [Chokidar][https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli] for file watching,
[Standard][https://github.com/feross/standard] for linting, [Ava][https://github.com/avajs/ava] for testing and [Precommit-hook][https://github.com/nlf/precommit-hook] for a repository cop.


There is a demo app setup so you can see how to develop in this environment.
